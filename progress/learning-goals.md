# Learning Goals - CS50 2025

## Primary Objectives

Learn computer science fundamentals through hands-on practice with multiple programming languages and technologies. Build a strong foundation in problem-solving and computational thinking.

## Core Areas of Focus

**Programming Languages**
- Master C programming and memory management
- Strengthen Python skills building on previous CS50 experience
- Compare different programming paradigms and approaches

**Computer Science Concepts**
- Understand algorithms and their efficiency
- Learn fundamental data structures
- Develop debugging and problem-solving methodologies

**Applied Technologies**
- Database design and SQL queries
- Web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend development with Flask
- Basic cybersecurity principles

## Personal Learning Approach

Document progress through well-organized code repositories and clear explanations of concepts learned. Focus on understanding the "why" behind each solution, not just the "how".

Connect new CS50 concepts with existing knowledge from my Information Management course. Use this opportunity to deepen understanding of computer science theory while building practical programming skills.

## End Goal

Complete a meaningful final project that demonstrates mastery of course concepts while contributing to my growing portfolio as a computer science student.
